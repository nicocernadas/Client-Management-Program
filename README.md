_**Project made for Computer Lab. II.**_

The program is fully functional. It reads, writes, and updates files while also handling potential user errors, such as incorrect data input.
It includes a validation system for date entries, which prevents the user from inputting a future date. It also features a functional menu that, for instance, does not allow displaying a file in the console if it has not yet been loaded or created.

_**To run the program:**_

- 1) You should simply download the 4 files, they are all necessary to run the program
    > It's very important to have them all when running, either way the program won't work.

- 2) Doubleclick the 'Main.exe' file, and maximize the command prompt for a better view
    > The program might not show completely sometimes, I don't know why this happens, just close the window and run again.

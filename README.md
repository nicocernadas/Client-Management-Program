_**Project made for Computer Lab. II.**_

The idea was to make a functional program using C, used to list clients, read from and write files, among other things.

_**To run the program:**_

- 1) You should simply download the 4 files, they are all necessary to run the program
    > It's very important to have them all when running, either way the program won't work.

- 2) Doubleclick the 'Main.exe' file, and maximize the command prompt for a better view
    > The program might not show completely sometimes, I don't know why this happens, just close the window and run again.

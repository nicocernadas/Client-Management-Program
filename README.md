_**Project made for Computer Lab. II.**_

The idea was to make a functional program using C, used to list clients, read from and write files, among other things.

To run the program:

- 1) You should simply copy the code from the "Main.cpp" file in your ide of choice, and then run it.

- 2) For a better view of the program, I highly recommend to maximize the command prompt or windows powershell where the program will run.
